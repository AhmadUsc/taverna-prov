/**
 * A security manager that disallows System.exit().
 * <p>
 * Methods calling {@link System#exit(int)} will instead fail with a
 * {@link ExitNotAllowed} exception.
 * <p>
 * To install this security manager, use {@link AvoidExit#install()} - and then
 * call {@link AvoidExit#uninstall()} on the returned instance, which will
 * restore the original security manager.
 * <p>
 * The installation and removal of security managers is by its nature NOT thread
 * safe. It is therefore not advisable to use {@link AvoidExit#install()} or
 * {@link AvoidExit#uninstall()} from more than one thread - as otherwise the
 * wrong 'old' security manager could be set.
 * <p>
 * In case this happens, this class will always revert to allowing System.exit
 * after {@link #uninstall()} has been called, in order for
 * {@link RuntimeException}s to cause normal exit of the JVM.
